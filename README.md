Animated led dice for Arduino with custom led matrix

## Functionality
The main idea was to animate a custom led matrix with Arduino from scratch. 

The functionality of the dice itself is as simple as you could imagine. The dice starts "shaking" when you hold the main button. When you release the button, it "rolls" until it generates a truly random number. 




## Istallation

Install LedDice.ino file and put it in a folder with the same name. Change the Arduino pins to match own setup and upload into arduino. 

Following led matrix pin setup was used:

## Important notes

The main language of the comments and documentation of this project was Finnish at first but later I translated it into English. 
Even though the project itself is physically simple, the c++ code itself was a personal challenge for me. My goals were to make the code as reliable and short as possible.

This project lacks comprehensive documentation and most likely will not be updated or developed any further.


## This project is made for personal experimental purposes
